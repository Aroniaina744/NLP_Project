This messenger bot helps people find homes for rent.
This bot responds according to the needs of the needy.
- We collected data on a facebook page of people who join to exchange information about available houses.
- We also used data from the local map of the city.
- We used linear regression and random forest as model with SCIKIT-LEARN as library.


We obtained an average of 80% on the results
