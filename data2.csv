This Option May be given in Product &gt; Tab: Accounting &gt; Here MIRO may give option 2 times debit and 2 times credit with the same amount. (Just be careful here &gt; MIRO evaluate either this double entry (2 debits &amp; 2 credit should be in Product&gt; OR in Product&gt;Tab: Accounting &gt; Internal Category because current configuration we define entries posting accounts here in internal category). 2.2 while creating invoice VAT also calculate and amount go to VAT Payable Account (I this it is already there and standard) 3: 3.1 Customer Payment Print Out (Single Payment Collection) 3.2 Customer Payment Multi (More than One Collection i.e Multi PDC, PDC &amp; cash, Credit Card &amp; Cash). This document as a whole shuld have separate Serial Number to manage.

End of each line the symbol or ARROW where we click and open full form (same as customer payment form) should open . Each line or form should take auto information from the top form fields like Customer name, mobile, Date, ???. Rest information user will fill accordingly whatever he is collecting. Now through Add Customer payment option even user can collect ""Cash, Credit Card &amp; PDC"" from a single customer against one invoice and again one main document. All lines of payment Total should be calculated at down. This is Just Multi Collection. After Save Posting of each customer payment line shall be same as existing single customer Payment. 4.
